# Description

**Anki download ID: `1384323610`**

An Anki add-on to slightly modify how the browse window handles tags.

## Available Features

- **expandTagsByDefault:** Displays all your hierarchical tags by default.
- **collapseSearchesByDefault:** Useful if you have your searches "duplicated"
  as filtered decks too, or if you just want searches to be hidden be default.
- **refreshTagListAfterDeletingTag** After you click the "Remove Tags" button
  in the browse window, the tag list will refresh itself to show that the tag
  was successfully removed.

# Requirements

To enable or disable features, you must edit the source code. You can find this
from the Anki menu *Tools &gt; Add-ons &gt; TagTweaks &gt; Edit..*.

This add-on assumes you also have the
[Hierarchical Tags](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1089921461)
add-on installed.

# Support

Post a [new issue on Github](https://github.com/Arthaey/anki-tag-tweaks/issues/new)
(or make a pull request!). You can also write a review or ask questions on the
[Anki website for shared add-ons](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1384323610).

[My other Anki add-ons](https://github.com/search?q=user%3AArthaey+anki)
are also on Github.

# TODO

- use the configured separator for HierarchicalTags, not "::"
- right-click on tag to rename or delete it
- UI for users to configure add-on without editing the code
